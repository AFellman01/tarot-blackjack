Once I had the game working, I decided I didn't actually like collecting crystals. Found it kind of dull. What do I like? Blackjack!

It's not a perfect conversion, but it was what I had been thinking about since I received my instructions for the crystal game. 

I'd like to set up another RNG to serve as the house, and make it so the player has to score more than the house but less than 22 to win. That was well beyond the scope of the assignment and early demos were not promising. I may work on it in my off time. This could be a good portfolio piece if I ever get it finished.

And I've considered adding the French major trumps as a fifth suit with a permanent value of 10. But everything does work more or less as intended, and I'm vaguely satisfied with it. I can assign the fifth suit its own variable, but it became messy.

Lessons for the future, I think, I need to really focus on the appending of javascript to css divisions. My attempts at doing so only broke things, so I struck them from the game. Probably could have left them commented out, but not really a priority for me. Also, seems I missed some information on zooming in and out? Not really sure? The game only works on my machine zoomed out at 80%, and doesn't work at all on a mobile screen.

May need a bootstrap refresher course. Not that I used bootstrap, but if I had, it may have worked better. I just don't really get it.
